# declarative-programming
 Designed and constructed Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) in Prolog to parse a small markup language used to describe layout of a poster. Further, interfaced this DCG to Finite Domains equation solver built in Prolog, in order to specify constraints on the poster layout and generate layout conforming to those constraints.
